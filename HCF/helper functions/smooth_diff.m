function h=smooth_diff(n)
% A smoothed differentiation filter (digital differentiator). 
%
% Such a filter has the following advantages:
% 
% First, the filter involves both the smoothing operation and differentation operation. 
% It can be regarded as a low-pass differention filter (digital differentiator). 
% It is well known that the common differentiation operation amplifies the high-frequency noises.
% Therefore, the smoothded differentiation filter would be valuable in experimental (noisy) data processing. 
% 
% Secondly, the filter coefficients are all convenient integers (simple units) except for an integer scaling factor,
% as may be especially significant in some applications such as those in some single-chip microcomputers
% or digital signal processors. 
% 
% Usage:
% h=smooth_diff(n)
% n: filter length (positive integer larger no less than 2)
% h: filter coefficients (anti-symmetry)
%
% Examples:
% smooth_demo
