% For Ar, the following two papers seem to require around 7 times weaker n2
% to match their experiments. We have done Ar experiments ourselves which
% show that this reducing factor isn't necessary. We suspect that these old
% works didn't do capillary experiments correctly. It's difficult to align
% the beam into the capillary, which I've been experiencing and is a huge 
% pain. Super straight capillary is required. Super high quality beam is
% also required. Without all these, higher-order modes arise, quickly
% deteriorating the beam spatial quality and the polarization extinction
% ratio. Strong polarization coupling in HE modes in a capillary has
% significant influence to nonlinear propagation.
